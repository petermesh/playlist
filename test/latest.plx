Sheâ??s always been skeptical about marriage, thinking the commitment would mean throwing away her future. She has let a string of steady boyfriends get away in favor of her own freedom. When she attends a fundraising event with friends Gregg (Chad Krowchuk) and Stephanie (Ali Liebert), she playfully agrees to have her fortune read at a charity booth run by soothsayer Madame Rue (Stefanie Powers), who ominously predicts Caryn will have an engagement ring by spring, or sheâ??ll never marry. Caryn doesnâ??t give much thought to Madame Rueâ??s fortune as she starts a new job with friendly, laid-back boss Tom Halsey (Kirby Morrow), with whom she has a lot in common. But when Stephanie and Greggâ??s fortunes come true, Caryn worries she might be closer to a ring than she thought from her uptight boyfriend, Bryce (Chris Jacot)./description
