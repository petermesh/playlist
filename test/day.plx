description=Thank you all for coming by.  Every Movie here is 1080P and 5.1 Surround Sound 
if you want a request or ask anything ilovethe80s@me.com
Movies were meant for surround sound and not highly compressed such as YIFY and others.
If you find any movie where the lip sync is off please let me know and ill fix it.

The goal for me here is to keep a good balance between video and audio quality at a small file size possible for streaming. There are already other teams delivering such, but to me they stress too much the filesize at the cost of quality, especially audio quality with lots of blocking artifacts in the video.
Some of the films to get a decent balance had to be AAC5.1 however XBMC will convert that to DD simply go to audio and turn speaker to 2.0 and enable passthrough and have AC3 capable receiver checked.

description=James Gunn's PG Porn is a web series created by the brothers James Gunn, Brian Gunn, and Sean Gunn. It consists of a series of pornography spoofs, with a humorous event occurring just before the supposed commencement of sexual acts. Each episode pairs a mainstream actor with a pornographic actress or model. The tagline is, "For people who love everything about Porn...except the sex."
The initial episode premiered on Spike.com and received over a million hits in a week, and was featured on Entertainment Weekly's The Must List. Spike subsequently picked up the series for an additional 11 episodes.
The project has, however, not been without controversy. The Huffington Post condemned the first episode for glorifying violence against women.
According to James, they developed the idea in the early 2000s, before short-term Internet-based sketch comedies became popular. Stephen Blackehart of The Good Boys Productions produced the show with Jake Zim and Peter Safran of Safran Digital Group (SDG) for Spike.com.
